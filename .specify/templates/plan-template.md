# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Java 17 with Spring Boot 3.x (per constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Spring Cloud, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, Maven (per constitution)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (per constitution), Redis for caching (per constitution)
**Testing**: JUnit 5 with 80% minimum coverage via Jacoco (per constitution)
**Target Platform**: Docker containers, AWS deployment via Terraform (per constitution)
**Project Type**: Microservice within logistics platform architecture (per constitution)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time, 99.9% availability (per constitution)
**Constraints**: Microservices-first architecture, API-first design with OpenAPI 3.0 (per constitution)
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise logistics platform supporting 1000+ consumption sites (per constitution)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Microservices-First**: Feature fits within established service boundaries or requires new service with clear API contract
- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: TDD approach planned with minimum 80% coverage target
- [ ] **API-First Design**: REST endpoints designed with OpenAPI 3.0 specification planned
- [ ] **Real-time Performance**: Sub-200ms response time requirements identified and planned
- [ ] **Security and Observability**: Authentication, monitoring, and logging requirements integrated into design

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
